{{--
    Wraps one element, and follows the pointer while it's over it: just below and after the pointer, moving to the
    other side of it near the window's edges. With the keyboard there's no pointer, so it sits under the focused element
    instead. It never takes the pointer (it would be in the way of what's under it) and Esc hides it. It sits in the top
    layer (a popover), so a table or a modal can't clip it. resources/js/widget/tooltip-cursor points the element's
    aria-describedby at it, so screen readers read it too.
