{{-- In a Livewire component, bind with wire:model.live (add .debounce.300ms to wait for a pause in typing); no name is needed. The box shows the property after every render, so clearing it in PHP empties it too, and the × button empties the property as if the text had been deleted. Filter in render(): ->where('name', 'like', "%{$this->search}%"). --}}
