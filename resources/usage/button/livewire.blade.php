{{-- In a wire:submit form, Livewire sends the form itself and holds the submit button until the answer comes back: the button shows its loading state meanwhile, keeps its colour, and gets focus back afterwards if it had it. A wire:click button shows it with wire:loading.attr="aria-busy" (and wire:target, so other requests don't set it off); a quick toggle is better without. :loading set from a property works too. --}}
