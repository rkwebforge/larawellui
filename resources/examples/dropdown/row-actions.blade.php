{{-- Actions for one record. With no trigger it's an icon-only button, so it needs a label naming the record. Edit is a link, Copy is a plain button for your own script (beside this), and Delete is a form that sends DELETE with its CSRF token once confirm has been answered. Uses orders.edit and orders.destroy routes from your app. --}}
